## üî∑ Overview

This solution deploys a simple web application (Nginx) on AWS EC2 instances with high availability and automatic scaling using ALB and ASG. It demonstrates best practices for scalability, security, and cost optimization.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](link-to-your-diagram.png)

### **Flow Explanation**

1. User requests are routed through the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
2. ALB distributes traffic across EC2 instances in the **Auto Scaling Group**.
3. The ASG spans **multiple Availability Zones** for high availability.
4. **CloudWatch** monitors instance health and performance.
5. **SNS** sends alerts for scaling activities or alarms.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Highly available web app using **multiple AZs**.
- **Auto Scaling policies** to handle demand changes.
- **IAM roles** for secure access.
- **CloudWatch alarms** with **SNS notifications**.
- Lightweight **user-data bootstrap** for Nginx installation.

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services Used

- Amazon EC2
- Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- IAM
- CloudWatch
- SNS

---

## üöÄ Deployment

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- IAM user with sufficient permissions (EC2, ALB, ASG, IAM, SNS, CloudWatch)
- AWS CLI configured or Management Console access
- SSH key pair (e.g., `Ahmed.pem`)

---

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create an IAM Role for EC2**
   - Service: EC2
   - Policies:
     - `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`
     - `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy`

2. **Prepare User Data Script**

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    yum update -y
    yum install -y nginx
    echo "<h1>Hello from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
    systemctl enable nginx
    systemctl start nginx
    ```

3. **Create Launch Template**
   - AMI: Amazon Linux 2
   - Instance Type: t2.micro
   - Key Pair: Ahmed.pem
   - Security Group: Allow **HTTP (80)** and **SSH (22)** from your IP
   - Attach IAM role
   - Paste user-data script

4. **Create Auto Scaling Group**
   - Launch template: select above
   - VPC: choose default/custom
   - Subnets: select **2+ AZs**
   - Desired capacity: 2  
   - Minimum: 1  
   - Maximum: 3  
   - Scaling policy: Target tracking (CPU > 50% scale out, < 20% scale in)

5. **Create Application Load Balancer**
   - Type: Internet-facing
   - Listeners: HTTP (80)
   - Target Group: EC2 Instances
   - Health Check: `/`

6. **Configure CloudWatch & SNS**
   - **CloudWatch Alarm**
     - Metric: EC2 CPU Utilization
     - Threshold: >70% for 5 minutes
   - **SNS Topic**
     - Subscribe your email
     - Link to CloudWatch alarm action

7. **Test**
   - Access ALB DNS from browser
   - Refresh to see load balancing across instances

---

## üí° Cost Optimization

- Use **t3.micro / t3a.micro** instances.
- Set minimum ASG capacity to **1** during low load.
- Clean up unused resources after testing.

---

## üßπ Cleanup

To avoid unwanted AWS charges:

- Delete ALB
- Delete Auto Scaling Group
- Delete Launch Template
- Delete IAM Role
- Delete SNS Topic and CloudWatch Alarms
